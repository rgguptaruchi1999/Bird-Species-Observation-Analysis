This project is dedicated to conducting a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing observations of various bird species. The primary objective is to explore and understand the ecological patterns and trends within the observed bird populations. This involves investigating the spatial and temporal distribution of different species, identifying their preferred habitats, and potentially analyzing behavioral aspects captured in the data. The insights gained from this analysis can contribute to a better understanding of local biodiversity, inform conservation initiatives, and support ecological research. The project will utilize data visualization and statistical techniques to uncover meaningful patterns and communicate the findings effectively.
